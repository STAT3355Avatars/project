# To merge datasets:

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Dataset has been transforemd using log-transformation. Log-transformation 
# compress data, especially extreme values. It scales them down to make the data more manageable and less skewed.

# Next Steps:

# 1: Perform Descriptive Statistics: Get a description and insight from our data

# 2: Visualize Descriptive Statistics : Visualize the described data:
        # Suggestion: To check trends over a period of time, look into Linecharts.
        # For categorical data: Look at Piecharts, Bargraphs and Cummulative Frequency Charts


# 3: Get a Good Sample and Normalize the data: Get the normal distribution 

# 4: Perform Inferential Statistics: Deal with Uncertainty and Test the Sample.
        # Suggestion: Look into Hypothesis Testing, One-Sample t-test, Two Sample  
        #    tests,  Tests for Proportions: Which is the best for our purpose(s)?

# 5: Find the Correlation and Regression between Multiple Variables:
        #  Suggestion: Look into Scatterplots, Heatmap, Corrplots 
       

# 6: Look into Lag Analysis/Time Series Analysis:



# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Perform Descriptive Statistics: 
# (a) The Center of the data : Mean, Median, Mode (We don't need Mode per se)?
  # example: What is the [insert tool e.g "mean"] of the [insert numerical      
              # variable e.g "revenue"]:
  # General Question: for all movies in all years? for all movies in each year?
  # Categorized question: for all movies in each genre? for each genre in each year?

# (b) Find the Measures of Dispersion:
        # Suggestion: Get the Range, Interquartile Range, Standard Deviation,
        # Variance, Coefficient of Variation? What do they tell us?

# (c) Find the Measures of Spread/Dispersion: How?
    # Suggestion: Look into Box-Plots, Violin Plots, Histograms,
                # Cummulative Frequency curves (for categorical data) / Maybe barcharts, grouped bar charts and stacked barcharts?


# (d) What is the Shape of the data? Define the Skewness of the data. How?
    # Suggestion: Every distribution can be standardized. Standardize the (log-transformed) datasets then visualize the standardized dataset to see the distribution.
